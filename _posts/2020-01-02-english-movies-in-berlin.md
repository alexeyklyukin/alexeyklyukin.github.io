If you are not a native German speaker in Berlin, or just prefer to see movies
with the original voice, chances are you've visited Cinestar at Potsdamer Platz
at least once. With the New Year bringing news about its closing, I've prepared
a short list of other movie theaters that screen movies with OVs (the particular
one I've been looking for is [Star Wars Episode IX](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527338/) ):

- [Cinestar Cubix am
  Alex](https://www.cinestar.de/kino-berlin-cubix-am-alexanderplatz) (perhaps
  other cinestars screen OVs as well, this is just the closest one to me)
- [UCI Kinowelt at Mercedes
  Platz](https://www.uci-kinowelt.de/kinoinformation/berlin-mercedes-platz/82)
  (seems to be particularly popular, there are no seats left for the new SW
  episode for the whole week).
- Both [York Kinos](https://www.yorck.de) (in Charlottenburg and Neuk√∂lln). Typically showing less
  mainstream movies, they have some high-profile movies nevertheless.

Happy moviegoing in 2020!
